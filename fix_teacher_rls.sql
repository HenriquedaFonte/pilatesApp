-- Fix RLS policies to allow teachers to view and manage student profiles
-- Run this in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor

-- Disable RLS temporarily to fix the recursion issue
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any existing policies that might conflict
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can update all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can insert profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can do everything" ON profiles;

-- Drop the function if it exists
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auth.is_teacher();

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a simple policy that allows all authenticated users to do everything
-- The application layer will handle the role-based access control
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated operations" ON profiles
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Note: This approach removes complex RLS logic and relies on application-level security
-- The actual teacher/student role checking should be done in the application code
